# Pinout
The two rows of pin headers are simply GPIO 0 - 19 on one side and GPIO 20 - 39 on the other. This means that the ADC pins can **not** be used on this board as they're simply unconnected.

VBUS is directly connected to the micro-usb connector. 3V3/VSYS is connected to the output of the voltage regulator.
